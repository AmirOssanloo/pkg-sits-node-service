# Explore New Features for Node Service Framework

**Feature Domain:** $ARGUMENTS (optional - defaults to comprehensive analysis)

Explores potential NEW features that would complement and extend the existing Node Service framework while staying close to the core functionality. Focuses on features that enhance the service framework ecosystem.

## Commands:

1. **Analyze Current Architecture** - Review the three-layer architecture (core → plugins → adapters)
2. **Identify Extension Opportunities** - Look for natural extensions to:
   - Configuration management system
   - Service lifecycle management
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Middleware ecosystem
   - Developer tooling
   - Framework utilities
3. **Research Complementary Features** - Consider:
   - Error handling and logging packages
   - Service discovery and health checks
   - Configuration validation tools
   - Development and debugging utilities
   - Testing and mocking frameworks
   - Performance monitoring (service-level)
4. **Evaluate Alignment** - Ensure features:
   - Stay close to Node.js service framework core
   - Enhance developer productivity
   - Maintain simplicity and minimal configuration
   - Follow the existing architecture patterns
5. **Rate and Prioritize** - Score each suggestion 1-10 considering:
   - Strategic value (1-5)
   - User demand/market fit (1-5)
   - Implementation complexity (1-5)
6. **Generate Report** - Create detailed analysis file at `./claude/exploration/[YYYY-MM-DD]_new-features_descriptive-name.md`

## Feature Scope:

**GOOD New Feature Examples:**
- Error handling package with standardized error types
- Service health check and metrics package
- Configuration CLI tools for validation/generation
- Testing utilities for service testing
- Middleware packages for common functionality
- Development tools for debugging services

**BAD New Feature Examples (Avoid):**
- Full database ORM (too broad)
- Frontend rendering capabilities (out of scope)
- Message queue systems (infrastructure concern)
- Payment processing (domain-specific)

## Output Requirements:

- Clear feature categorization by domain
- Technical implementation overview
- Integration points with existing framework
- Market research and demand analysis
- Risk assessment and maintenance burden
- Roadmap recommendations with phasing

If the framework is feature-complete for its scope, state clearly that additional features would create bloat without significant value.
